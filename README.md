# Pyenv-Mirror: the pyenv's unofficial Python archives mirror

https://pymirror.com/

Pyenv is a simple and powerful python version and environment management tool. Unfortunately python source files download speed is very slow in china during the installation of python with pyenv, so I created this mirror to speedup the download. 

## Usage

```
export PYTHON_BUILD_MIRROR_URL="https://pymirror.com/dist/python/"
```
