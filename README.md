# Pyenv-Mirror: the pyenv's unofficial Python archives mirror

https://pymirror.com/

Pyenv is a simple and powerfull python version and environment management tool. Unfortuanlly python source files download speed is very slow in china during the installion of python with pyenv, so I create this mirror to speedup the download. 

## Usage

```
export PYTHON_BUILD_MIRROR_URL="https://pymirror.com/dist/python/"
```
